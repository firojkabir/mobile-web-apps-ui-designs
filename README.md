### App 1: GentWear
**Description:** 

In UI design, minimalism speaks volumes. This **GentWear** app puts products in the spotlight thanks to white space and prominent fonts’ skillful use. The color scheme is subdued, so it doesn’t distract the user from the merchandise.

### App 2: Little Rome Cafe
**Description:**

Product/Service search apps are frequently over-detailed and disorderly. Instead of providing help, they confuse and annoy the user. **Little Rome Cafe** app design is the exact opposite. It sticks to a natural, harmonious color scheme, gets rid of unnecessary details, neatly organizes the content using tags, filters, and categories, and is optimized for mobiles. It ticks all the boxes!

Products and categories are presented using a card-based layout, providing an organized and visually appealing browsing experience.
