### App 1: GentWear
**Description:** 

In UI design, minimalism speaks volumes. This **GentWear** app puts products in the spotlight thanks to white space and prominent fonts’ skillful use. The color scheme is subdued, so it doesn’t distract the user from the merchandise.

### App 2: Little Rome Cafe
**Description:**

Product/Service search apps are frequently over-detailed and disorderly. Instead of providing help, they confuse and annoy the user. **Little Rome Cafe** app design is the exact opposite. It sticks to a natural, harmonious color scheme, gets rid of unnecessary details, neatly organizes the content using tags, filters, and categories, and is optimized for mobiles. It ticks all the boxes!
